# Community Contributions

We are happy to consider new builder images suggested by the community. To
suggest a new builder image, please help us identify an existing
community-maintained image that would be helpful to include as a Cloud Builder.

If you would like to see additional functionality added to an existing Cloud
Builder, please get involved in the existing community that supports and
maintains the root image on which the Cloud Builder is based.

For example, the [README.md for the `mvn` builder](maven) identifies
[Dockerhub's maven community](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven) as its source.
Enhancements to maven should be discussed there.

# Compatibility with Hosted GCB

If you have ideas to help enable stronger compatibility with the hosted Google
Cloud Build service, please open an issue or send us a pull request.

Bugs in Cloud Builders that are not present in the underlying images should be
reported in the Issues section in this repository. Bugs that are present in the
underlying images should be reported to the appropriate source community.

Issues with the hosted Cloud Build service should be reported to Google Cloud
Support or [filed as new bugs in the public issue
tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=190802&template=1162743).

# Pull Requests

While you should feel free to assign a reviewer to your pull request if you

an owner on receipt of your suggested changes. Emergencies aside, we typically
respond to pull requests within 2-3 business days once the CLA is signed.
