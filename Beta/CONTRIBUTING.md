# Community Contributions

We are happy to consider new builder images suggested by the community. To
suggest a new builder image, please help us identify an existing
community-maintained image that would be helpful to include as a Cloud Builder.

If you would like to see additional functionality added to an existing Cloud
Builder, please get involved in the existing community that supports and
maintains the root image on which the Cloud Builder is based.

For example, the [README.md for the `mvn` builder](maven) identifies
[Dockerhub's maven community](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven) as its source.
Enhancements to maven should be discussed there.

# Compatibility with Hosted GCB

If you have ideas to help enable stronger compatibility with the hosted Google
Cloud Build service, please open an issue or send us a pull request.
